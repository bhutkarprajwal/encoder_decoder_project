Encoder-Decoder Project
This repository implements an encoder-decoder system for serializing and deserializing data structures into deterministic octet sequences and vice versa. The project adheres to a specified format for encoding various data types, including basic values, integers, sequences, and dictionaries, as described in the provided SPEC.md. The implementation is capable of handling complex nested structures and ensures correctness, performance, and error handling.

Features:
Encoding & Decoding: Supports basic data types such as None, bytes, int, list, and dict, handling both simple and nested structures.
Serialization: Converts Python objects into byte sequences with precise ordering and data integrity.
Deserialization: Converts byte sequences back into the corresponding Python data structures.
Test Vectors: Includes predefined test vectors to verify the correctness of the implementation.
Performance Testing: Includes a script for generating large test data to measure encoding and decoding efficiency.
Project Structure:
encoder.py: Contains the logic for encoding data into byte sequences.
decoder.py: Contains the logic for decoding byte sequences back into Python data structures.
test_encoder_decoder.py: Unit tests to validate the encoder and decoder functionality against test vectors.
perf_test_gen.py: Script to generate large test data files for performance testing.
SPEC.md: Documentation of the serialization specification followed by the project.
Usage:
Clone the repository.
Run the encoder and decoder scripts with different data structures.
Execute the test cases and performance tests.
Check the test results in result.json.
Evaluation Criteria:
Correctness: Ensuring that encoding and decoding are done accurately with the correct ordering.
Code Quality: Clean, readable code with proper error handling and type checks.
Performance: Efficient handling of large datasets with optimized memory usage.
